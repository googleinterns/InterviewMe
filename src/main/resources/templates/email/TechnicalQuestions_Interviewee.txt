Hello {{interviewee_first_name}},

We see that you registered for a {{position}} mock interview with InterviewMe on {{formatted_date}}. As these interviews usually come with technical questions, we wanted to share with you some tips.

  Repeat/clarify the question with the interviewer.
    - Pay attention for hints.
    - Vagueness is expected. This gives you the chance to define the problem better.

  Brainstorm potential solutions.
    - Start with the obvious/worst case.
    - Draw pictures.
    - Evaluate potential solutions by running time.
    - Remember, this is a conversation, not a monologue.

  Before coding:
    - Make sure you understand your approach.
    - Make sure the interviewer understands your approach.
    - You may want to pick a suboptimal approach if it's easier to code (although often the optimal approach is the simplest.)
    - Think about APIs, function signatures, etc.

  During coding:
    - Small syntax/language issues are OK, but avoid pseudo-code.
    - Subroutines can help clarify code/allow you to skip writing some code.
    - Style counts; use semantically meaningful names.

  After coding:
    - Talk about testing and test cases in general.
    - Finally, talk about other possibly more efficient solutions with the interviewer.

Please reach out to interviewme.business@gmail.com if you have any questions.   
Best of luck!
