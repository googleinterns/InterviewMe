Hello {{interviewer_first_name}},

We see that you will be giving a {{position}} mock interview with InterviewMe on {{formatted_date}}. These interviews usually come with technical questions, which you should use to measure the candidate's competency. We wanted to share with you some tips on handling this technical portion.

  - Leave some vagueness in the question. This gives the candidate the opportunity to ask clarifying questions.
  - Does the candidate have the right approach in mind? Or will it lead them in the wrong direction? If you feel they are on the wrong track, provide a hint that will bring them in the right direction.
  - Does the candidate make progress through the question? If they haven't been progressing, maybe it's time for a hint. 
  - Remember, this is a conversation, not a monologue.
  - If the candidate doesn't do so, prompt them to consider run times of proposed solutions.
  - Finally, talk about other possibly more efficient solutions with the interviewee.

Please reach out to interviewme.business@gmail.com if you have any questions.   
Best of luck!
